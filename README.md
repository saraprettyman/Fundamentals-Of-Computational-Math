# Sara Prettyman's math4610 site
The repository that you are looking at is dedicated to the course work for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics (MATH 4610) during Fall 2022. \
My programming language of choice is Python for the duration of this course. The IDE I intend to be using is Brackets. When called for, I use C in the IDE Visual Studio Code.
